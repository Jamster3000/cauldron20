# What is this? 🔮
Cauldron20, a chrome extension that provides functionalily between character sheets on [dndbeyond](https://www.dndbeyond.com/) and [Cauldron](https://www.cauldron-vtt.net). Although not yet completed, it reads data from a character sheet on dndbeyond and can use different data from it into different areas of cauldron VTT.

# How it works
This works by clicking on the extension and entering your character sheet's number (e.g. 112012248). This will then use dndbeyond's api for character sheets. It will remember your character so this will be a one time input. If you want to use a different character just input a new number and your old character will be replaced with the new one.

# Installation
To install and try this work-in-progress extension
1) Install all the code on this github
2) extract the code from the zip folder
3) Open Chome and navigate to extensions [chome extensions](chrome://extensions/)
4) Make sure that developer mode is enabled on top right.
5) Top left, choose "load unpacked" and choose the folder that contains the code.
6) Clicking on the extention and input the number that identifies your character (make sure that your character sheet on dndbeyond is in public so it can be accessed by the extension)

The extension should work as intended. 

> [!NOTE]
> This is a work in progress and there is likley to be many issues and bugs to happen.

I would like to also add to this that I don't know JavaScript and I honeslty think it's a headache for me until I get the hang of this.
